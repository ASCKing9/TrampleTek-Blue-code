Ver 0.1.2
 - Added reboot_timeout to api (180s) and wifi (60s), to better catch which one is causing more issues.
 - Changed the calibration routine so the lower threshold adjustment to be closer to the upper limit, helps to better capture "in bed" events after a calibration.
 - Reduced the required change in "in bed" and "out of bed" signal from 50% of the current difference in the upper and lower thresholds to 25%. Hoping to catch more subtle changes in the signal over time. 
 - Reduced some unneeded variables in the main signal logic loop: "previousIsOnState" and "IsOn" may have be causing an issue with not updating the binary sensor state correctly.
 - Added secret wifi credentials into the wifi sections
 - Moved "Sensitivity" slider into the diagnostic area of the device, renamed variable in YAML for clarity
 - Renamed "24hr Dynamic Threshold reduction factor" to "Threshold Convergence Factor" so it was a little more clear-ish what it is.
 - Threshold Convergence Factor is now adjustable and will update the thresholds immediately instead of waiting for the next dynamic threshold evaluation.

Ver 0.1.1
 - Change the default "Transition to On Delay" to 3 seconds, down from 5.
 - Add a reset counter to tell when the device power cycles (trying to capture unintentional restarts), it counts to 5 and then the next restart is set back to 0.
 - Added a wifi signal strength UI element
 - Added a CPU internal temperature UI element 
 - Removed all the extra debug logging, was worried it was causing connectivity issues sending to much in a short time period

Ver 0.1.0
 - Automatic update notifications and HTTP ota enabled
 - Added several UI elements for people to tune to their desired accuracy and delay:
    - "24hr Dynamic Threshold reduction factor" This changes how close together the daily dynamic thresholds will be, higher is closer together (6 is default)
    - "Transition to on Delay" is the amount of time the sensor must be consecutively above the defined threshold before triggering the "on" state
    - "Transition to off Delay" is the amount of time the sensor must be consecutively above the defined threshold before triggering the "off" state
