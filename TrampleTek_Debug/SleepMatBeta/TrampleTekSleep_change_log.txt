Ver 0.1.0
 - Automatic update notifications and HTTP ota enabled
 - Added several UI elements for people to tune to their desired accuracy and delay:
    - "24hr Dynamic Threshold reduction factor" This changes how close together the daily dynamic thresholds will be, higher is closer together (6 is default)
    - "Transition to on Delay" is the amount of time the sensor must be consecutively above the defined threshold before triggering the "on" state
    - "Transition to off Delay" is the amount of time the sensor must be consecutively above the defined threshold before triggering the "off" state

Ver 0.1.1
 - Change the default "Transition to On Delay" to 3 seconds, down from 5.
 - Add a reset counter to tell when the device power cycles (trying to capture unintentional restarts), it counts to 5 and then the next restart is set back to 0.
 - Added a wifi signal strength UI element
 - Added a CPU internal temperature UI element 
 - Removed all the extra debug logging, was worried it was causing connectivity issues sending to much in a short time period
